Images are scaled so that the width matches the available space and then
the height follows. Image appear to be centered vertically.

So for other sizes, make the width match other images of that type and
make the height less than or equal to the other types.


Limit blog thumbnail widths to 70px
Limit blog 'full-size' to 140

Project:
--------
Images need to be the same aspect ratio so that the array fills properly.
Background should be something other than transparent or white.

Are projects the individual parts like the T&L Node, database, gauge web
page, plot web page, etc or more general categories like
UI/Firmware/Hardware, etc.

T&L Node: Hardware (PCB image)
T&L Node: Firmware (PCB image with chip in corner)

Project page could describe specs, goals, and operation. Links to github
and offers of sale would go on the project pages.

Associate blog posts would discribe the implementation and results.
