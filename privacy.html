            I am using Google Analytics on this site. That means that information
            about your visit to this site is being collected unless you take steps
            to opt-out (see below).
            </p>
            <h4>What is Google Analytics?</h4>
            <p>
            Google Analytics is a widely used service from Google that grabs
            data about visitors to this site (you) and provides summaries of
            that information. A few of the things Google Analytics records
            are:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The website you came from to get here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How long you spent looking at this site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The type of computer and browser you are using.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google Analytics reports website trends without identifying
            individual visitors.</p>

            <h4>What do I do with your data?</h4>
            <p>The tracking information allows me to determine how many
            people visit this site and what pages  they find most
            interesting.  </p>
            <p> Google Analytics provides this information as statistical
            data about visitors browsing actions and patterns. The
            information and reports do not identify individuals.  </p>
            <p> My activity falls within the bounds of the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">
                Google Analytics Terms of Service
            </a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Want to opt out of tracking?</h4>
            <p> You have several options, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">
                        Opt-out of Googleâ€™s advertising tracking cookie.
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">
                        Use a browser plugin to opt out of all Google
                        Analytics tracking software.
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
