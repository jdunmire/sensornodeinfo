Sensor Node Information
=======================
This a Jekyll based website to document the design and use of ESP-8266

point is commit cd5c599e9d on the master branch. The project was cloned
and then the git archive command was used to transfer the files to this
archive:

    $ git clone git@github.com:st4ple/solid-jekyll.git
    $ cd solid-jekyll
    $ git archive --format=tar HEAD | (cd ../sensornodeinfo/ && tar xf -)
