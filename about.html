            <h4>RockingD Labs</h4>
            <p><a href="rockingdlabs.dunmire.org/about">RockingD Labs</a> is
            the moniker I use for my projects, experiments, and
            explorations as an engineer and a <i>maker</i>. </p>
            <p>This site documents devices, software, and network I am
            using to implement a network of sensors for my house. I
            know, that is not a very unique project. Still, I haven't
            found what I'm looking for in other designs and for me it is
            fun and rewarding excercise.</p>
            <p>If you find the information here useful or would like to
            contribute (even if it is only comments, suggestions, or
            pointing out mistakes), I would be happy to hear from you.
            Just use the button below (for now the <i>Us</i> is just a
            pretension).
