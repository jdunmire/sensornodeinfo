How To add documentation to this web site
=========================================
Notes on what needs to be done and how to do it.

Local testing
-------------
Run jekyll in this directory. The URL for the website will be reported
in the jekyll output.

   $ jekyll server
   or
   $ jekyll server -w  # watch files for changes (default for some jekyll versions)
   or
   $ jekyll server --drafts  #to include the drafts.


Project Component
-------------------
 * Post goes in _posts/components/ directory and must have the form
      YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md  (other markups extensions are supported).
      * set image: to the file in assets/img/components/
 
 * Choose an image and make three sizes. The first two are for use with
   associated blog posts.
    * 144x108 goes in assests/img/blog/
    * 70x70 (or 70x53) goes in assets/img/blog/thumbs
    * 640x480 goes in assets/img/components/

 * (optional) Other images to document the component.
    * large, 16:9
    * 1280x720, jpg (90%) seems to produce reasonable size files.
    * place in assets/img/components/carousel/
    * file names for the  are specified in the
      _posts/components/<component_post> file so they could be anything,
      but using the post tile in the image name will make them easier to
      associate with the post.

 * Question: Should a permalink tag be used to organize the components?
             If so, what form should the tag take?

Blog Entries
------------
 * post goes in _posts/blog/ and must have the form
   YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md (other markups extensions are suppoted).
 * Blog entries related to the project should reference the
   assets/img/blog/ and assets/img/blog/thumbs/ images
 * Organize links to blog by date using the permalink: tag.
        /blog/YYYY/MM/DD/<title>
 * If comments will be allowed, create an issue at github and include
   the commentIssueId: tag. The tag value is the issue number
 * Categories:

        Hardware
        Firmware
        Network
        UserInterface
        Database


Cute illustration ideas
-----------------------
  * use the node grid background
  * use strings of binary to represent data
  * put a jumble of binary in a woven basket to represent the database
  * use the binary in a chip to represent firmware
  * use a montior image full of binary to represent software
  * use gauges and knobs to represent the UI

For related projects add the vector graphic illustration to a corner of
the image to destinguish the different, but related, projects. For
example the PCB for T&L Node for the hardware and the PCB with the
firmware image to cover the firmware for the T&L Node.


Project Components Page
-----------------------
This is a list of the components.
Make it more like the blog page.
Large left area with list of components, image, title, short desc.
Right column with Categories:

TO DO
-----

  * Fill out component description for T&L Node Firmware.
  * Check links
  * Add component description for graphs (status could be concept)
  * Add component description for DB (status could be concept)
  * Add component description for protocol (MQTT) (status could be
    concept)
  * Add blog post announcing the T&L Node * components
  * Push to git hub

  * DONE: Privacy notice and enable tracking
  * DONE: Fill-out component descriptions for T&L Node
  * FIXED: Remove extra blog posts
  * FIXED: Components tag does not work (no components section on the category pages)
  * FIXED: Add links to repository as part of component blog post

     - image size needs to change  DONE
     - Add component status legend: concept, active, obsolete  DONE
     - Show only active on the front page, all on the project components
       page. DONE
  * DONE: Change component page to list related blog posts at the side, like
