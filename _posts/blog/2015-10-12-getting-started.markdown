Well, not really. I've been working on a sensor node design most of
2015 and it is based on a long term desire to have small, low cost,
wireless sensor nodes for my house and yard. This is just the start of
documenting and sharing my work.

There are a lot of moving pieces in this project, so rather than adding
it to one of my existing sites ([dunmire.org][dunmire_org] or the newer
[RockingDLabs][rockingdlabs] site) I think it deserves its own home.
