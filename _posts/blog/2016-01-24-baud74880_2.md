My hubris is showing: In
[ESP-8266, Ubuntu, and 74880 baud](/blog/2016/01/19/baud74880) I solved
my problem with 74880 baud the hard way. Rather than looking at the
alternatives (and with Linux/Ubuntu there is always an alternative, and
usually more than one) I assumed that other terminal programs would have
a fixed list of speeds like `minicom`. Well, I was wrong.

[Brian Walton](https://plus.google.com/101270674426763943785) pointed
out that `miniterm.py` will accept 74800 baud. Furthermore, I already
had `miniterm.py` installed!

<!--more-->
`miniterm.py` is part of the
[python-serial](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/python-serial/filelist)
package. It can be installed with the usual `apt-get` procedure:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-serial

`miniterm.py` is pretty bare bones, but it will certainly do what I
need. It starts from the command line like this:

    $ miniterm.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 74880
    --- Miniterm on /dev/ttyUSB0: 74880,8,N,1 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+]  |  Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---


Should there come a time that I need more functionality than
`miniterm.py` provides, there are still more alternatives to checkout:

  * `cu`
  * `screen`
  * `putty`
  * `tip`
  * ...

Got to love Linux!
