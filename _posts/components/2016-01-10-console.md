###Template

The T&L Node Console is a
[responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)
[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) website built from a [HTML5
Boilerplate](http://www.initializr.com) template. The template was
customizied with these H5BP Options:

  * IE Classes
  * Old browser warning
  * Favicon
  * Apple and Windows Icons
  * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

These H5BP Options were omitted because the T&L Console is intended for
internal home use only and these don't make sense if the website is not
generally accessible:

  * Google Analytics
  * .htaccess
  * plugins.js
  * Robots.txt
  * Humans.txt
  * Adobe Cross Domain
  * 404 Page

###Additions
The javascript MQTT client is from
[paho](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js).

The basis for the real-time gauges is [JustGage](http://justgage.com)

###Installation and setup
These instructions work for Ubuntu and assume that a working Apache2
HTTP server has been configured:

  1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/jdunmire/TLnodeConsole)
     __Note__: the directory you clone into must be accessible by the
               user that is used to run the Apache2 server. On Ubuntu
               this is typically `www-data`.

  1. Copy the `TLnodeConsole.conf` file to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`

  1. Modify the `/etc/apache2/sites-available/TLnodeConsole.conf` file:
      - Replace `XXX_FULL_PATH_TO_TLnodeConsole_html` (two places) with
        the full path to the `html/` directory.

  1. Set your MQTT configuration by copying the XXXX file to XXXX and modify the values as appropriate for your network.

  1. Enable the new site:

    $ sudo a2ensite TLnodeConsole

The TLnodeConsole web site should now be available at http://localhost:8888/.
